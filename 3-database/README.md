During the database task, I developed practical skills in setting up and managing a MySQL database within a Docker container. This included creating a Docker container with MySQL, importing a database dump into the container, executing SQL queries to interact with the database, creating users and granting permissions, performing database operations such as querying data and calculating average salaries per department.
